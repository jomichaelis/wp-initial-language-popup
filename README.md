# WP Initial Language Popup

This plugin adds a simple popup to select the initial language of your website at the first visit.
No matter which site you are heading to, the popup will appear and ask you to select your language.

As of now, the plugin only redirects to "/de_ls/..." to enable easy language support for a German website.
